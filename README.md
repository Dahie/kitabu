# kitabu

While Prince is too expensive (495USD for a single user license), the free version available at <http://www.princexml.com/download> generates a PDF with a small logo on the first page, which is removed when sent to a printer.

## Features

* Write using Markdown
* Book layout support
* Syntax highlight
* Generate HTML, PDF, e-Pub, Mobi and Text files
* Table of Contents automatically generated from chapter titles

## Installation

To install Kitabu, you’ll need a working Ruby 1.9+ installation.
If you’re cool with it, just run the following command to install it.

    gem install kitabu

After installing Kitabu, run the following command to check your external
dependencies.

    $ kitabu check

    Prince XML: Converts HTML files into PDF files.
    Installed.

    KindleGen: Converts ePub e-books into .mobi files.
    Installed.

    html2text: Converts HTML documents into plain text.
    Not installed.

There are no hard requirements here; just make sure you cleared the correct dependency based on the formats you want to export to.

## Usage

To create a new e-book, just run

    $ kitabu new mybook

This command creates a directory `mybook` with the following structure:

    mybook
    ├── code
    ├── config
    │   ├── helper.rb
    │   └── kitabu.yml
    ├── images
    ├── output
    ├── templates
    │   ├── epub
    │   │   ├── cover.erb
    │   │   ├── cover.png
    │   │   ├── page.erb
    │   │   └── user.css
    │   └── html
    │       ├── layout.css
    │       ├── layout.erb
    │       ├── syntax.css
    │       └── user.css
    └── text
        └── 01_Welcome.md

The `config/kitabu.yml` file holds some information about your book; so you'll always change it.

Now it's time to write your e-book. All your book content will be placed on the text directory. Kitabu requires you to separate your book into chapters. A chapter is nothing but a directory that holds lots of text files. The e-book will be generated using every folder/file alphabetically. So be sure to use a sequential numbering as the name. Here's a sample:

    * text
      * 01_Introduction
        * 01_introduction.md
      * 02_What_is_Ruby_on_Rails
        * 01_MVC.md
        * 02_DRY.md
        * 03_Convention_Over_Configuration.md
      * 03_Installing_Ruby_on_Rails
        * 01_Installing.md
        * 02_Mac_OS_X_instructions.md
        * 03_Windows_instructions.md
        * 04_Ubuntu_Linux_instructions.md

If you prefer, you can add a chapter per file:

    * text
      * 01_Introduction.md
      * 02_What_is_Ruby_on_Rails.md
      * 03_Installing_Ruby_on_Rails.md

You'll want to see your progress eventually; it's time for you to generate the book PDF. Just run the command `kitabu export` and your book will be created on the `output` directory.

Kitabu can generate a Table of Contents (TOC) based on your h2-h6 tags. The h1 tag is discarded because it's meant to be the book title.

To print the TOC, you need to print a variable called +toc+, using the eRb tag.

    <%= toc %>

### Syntax Highlighting

To highlight code, use fenced code blocks.

    ``` ruby
    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      validates_presence_of :login, :password, :email
      validates_uniqueness_of :login, :email
    end
    ```

You can even provide options:

    ```php?start_inline=1&line_numbers=1
    echo "Hello World";
    ```

- We use [Redcarpet](https://rubygems.org/gems/redcarpet) for Markdown processing.
- We use [Rouge](https://rubygems.org/gems/rouge) for syntax highlighting.

The following Redcarpet options are enabled:

* `autolink`
* `fenced_code_blocks`
* `footnotes`
* `hard_wrap`
* `highlight`
* `no_intra_emphasis`
* `safe_links_only`
* `space_after_headers`
* `strikethrough`
* `superscript`
* `tables`
