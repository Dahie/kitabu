## What’s Next?

Now that you’ve seen your first Rails application, you should feel free to update it and experiment on your own. But you don’t have to do everything without help. As you need assistance getting up and running with Rails, feel free to consult these support resources:

* The [Ruby on Rails guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/index.html)
* The [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.org/book)
* The [Ruby on Rails mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk)
* The [#rubyonrails](irc://irc.freenode.net/#rubyonrails) channel on irc.freenode.net
* The [Rails Wiki](http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/)

Rails also comes with built-in help that you can generate using the rake command-line utility:

* Running `rake doc:guides` will put a full copy of the Rails Guides in the `doc/guides` folder of your application. Open `doc/guides/index.html` in your web browser to explore the Guides.
* Running `rake doc:rails` will put a full copy of the API documentation for Rails in the `doc/api` folder of your application. Open `doc/api/index.html` in your web browser to explore the API documentation.
